= Overview - Arc-E-Tect Phonebook
This is the Arc-E-Tect Phonebook application, it is an _API-only_ application, which means that the application has no user interface, instead, all information and functionality is exposed through an API. The provided API of the Arc-E-Tect Phonebook is RESTful and exposed through http endpoints.

This application is used to explain how to develop API-First, or API-Only applications in such a way that it is inherrently secure and of high quality. This process of software engineering is described on the https://arc-e-tect.blog/subscribe[Arc-E-Tect blog]. You can read the first episode of this course through this link: https://medium.com/codex/software-engineering-done-right-de312acf5c0?sk=5ed46509dc43749970dc94649bbd0855[Software Engineering done Right].
